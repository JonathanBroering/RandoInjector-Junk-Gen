# RandoInjector Junk Gen
If you are using the RandoInjector for CS:GO Cheating then you have to change the bytes to random bytes.
From Source of RandoInjector:

// 1. change all bytes(0x00, 0x01, 0x03....) in define "JUNKS" to random bytes

// 2. change size this block by add new bytes
# Usage
(1) Run the python file (python must be installed)

(2) Enter the Amount of bytes which should get generated.

(3) Copy and Replace the old ones from the RandoInjector with the new gernerated ones.


This is not a 100% safe way to do not get VAC banend (i guess). But should help you.

Stay safe.


To make it more simple i wrote the script.
The code might be shitty, but it does work.
